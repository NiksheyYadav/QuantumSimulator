## Installation Guide for quantum_simulation

This guide walks you through the process of installing and setting up the `quantum_simulation` library for simulating quantum systems.

**Prerequisites**

Before diving in, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python:** You'll need Python version 3.x (3.7 or later is recommended). You can check your version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. If you need to install Python, visit the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip:** Pip is a package installer for Python. Most modern Python installations come bundled with pip. You can verify its presence by running `pip --version` in your terminal. If not installed, refer to the official documentation for instructions: [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

**Installation Steps**

There are two main ways to install the `quantum_simulation` library:

**1. Using pip:**

This is the recommended method for most users. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install quantum_simulation
```

This will download and install the latest version of the library along with any dependencies it requires.

**2. From Source (Optional):**

If you prefer to install from source, you'll need to clone the project repository and build it manually.

* **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/quantum_simulation.git
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your actual GitHub username if you have the code hosted there. Otherwise, update the URL to point to the correct location of the source code.

* **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd quantum_simulation
   ```

* **Install dependencies (refer to requirements.txt):**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install any external libraries needed by the project.

* **Build the library:**

   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

   This will build and install the library into your Python environment.

**Verifying Installation:**

Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -c "import quantum_simulation; print(quantum_simulation.__version__)"
```

This should output the installed version of the `quantum_simulation` library.

**Additional Notes**

* If you encounter any errors during installation, make sure you have the necessary permissions and refer to the troubleshooting section in the documentation (if available).
* For advanced users, you can explore creating a virtual environment for isolating project dependencies.

We hope this guide helps you successfully install and set up the `quantum_simulation` library. Now you're ready to explore the world of quantum simulations!
