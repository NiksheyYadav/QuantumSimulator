## quantum_simulation API Reference

This document serves as a comprehensive reference for all the classes and functions available in the `quantum_simulation` library. 

**Structure:**

The API reference is organized by modules within the library. Each module will have a brief description of its purpose, followed by details about its classes and functions.

**Example Structure:**

```
## quantum_state.py

This module provides functionalities for representing and manipulating quantum states.

### Classes:

* **Qubit:** Represents a single qubit and its state (|0>, |1>, or superposition).
    * Methods:
        * `get_state()`: Returns the current state of the qubit as a complex number.
        * `set_state(state)`: Sets the state of the qubit to a specified complex number.
        * `apply_gate(gate)`: Applies a quantum gate to the qubit.

### Functions:

* **tensor_product(state1, state2)`: Creates a tensor product of two quantum states.
* **measure(state)`: Performs a measurement on the state and returns the outcome (0 or 1) with its probability.
```

**Documenting Classes:**

For each class, include:

* A short description of the class's purpose.
* A list of all methods available in the class.
    * Each method should have its functionality explained.
    * Mention required parameters and their data types.
    * Specify the return value of the method and its data type.
* Add code examples whenever possible to illustrate method usage.

**Documenting Functions:**

For each function, include:

* A clear description of what the function does.
* A list of all parameters required by the function and their data types.
* Explain the expected data type of the return value.
* Include code examples to demonstrate function usage.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Maintain a consistent style and format throughout the documentation.
* Organize the API reference logically, grouping related classes and functions.
* Consider using a tool like Sphinx (Read the Docs [invalid URL removed] ) for generating interactive API documentation.

**Remember:** This is a general guideline. You can adapt the structure and content based on the specific functionalities offered by your `quantum_simulation` library.
